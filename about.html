            <p>
              I am Mr. Progtech, a student from a small town who has a passion
              for robotics. My interest in technology makes me keep creating all
              kinds of Arduino projects, are not only fun but also interesting.
            </p>
            <p>
              I feel that knowledge is to be shared, and in order to pass on
              what I have learned I dedicate myself to helping others. (I try
              really hard). This space is meant for everyone: a pupil who has no
              ideas; or even for a teacher who wants to make the lesson more
              interesting with some projects. Here you will find information on
              how to use different accessories with arduino in everyday life.
              Basics of robotics are easy and interesting enough that anybody
              can learn them and put in his own time on them.
            </p>
            <p>
              My mission is not only to educate but also to inspire. With this
              in mind, I want to encourage people to be creative, to see how
              they can use technology to bring their ideas to life. From
              automating simple tasks to creating complex systems,
              programming offers a world of possibilities, and I would like to help
              others discover and explore this exciting field.
            </p>

            <p>
              So, join me on this journey as we dive into the awesome world of
              robotics and programming.

              <b>Hardware: </b>Arduino boards play a vital role in creating
              various projects. The different components on Arduino boards are:
              microcontroller, digital input/output pins, analog pins, USB
              connector, reset button, LEDs and some other small components that
              differ depending on the type of board.
              <br />
              There are no limits with Arduino. They are able to read inputs -
              button press or distance - and turn them into outputs - lighting
              up an LED, displaying on an LCD screen or on your computer.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Software: </b>This the platform where you can tell your board
              what to do by sending instuctions in C and C++. It's called
              Arduino IDE. You can install a different version from the
              <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/software"
                >official Arduino website</a
              >.
