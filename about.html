          <p>
            I'm Mr. Progtech, a student from a little town with my passion for
            robotics. My fascination with technology drives me to create various
            projects using Arduino, constantly pushing the boundaries of what's
            possible.
            <br />I firmly believe that knowledge is meant to be shared. That's
            why I dedicate myself to passing on what I've learned to others.
            Whether it's through detailed tutorials, or collaborative projects,
            my goal is to make robotics and programming accessible and enjoyable
            for everyone (I try really hard). I strive to ensuring that anyone
            can understand the basics and start their own journey in the world
            of programming. <br />
            My mission is not only to educate but also to inspire. I aim to
            kindle a love for creating in others, showing them the endless
            possibilities that come with understanding and utilizing technology.
            From automating simple tasks to creating sophisticated systems,
            programming offers a world of possibilities, and I want to help
            others discover and explore this exciting field.
          </p>

          <p>
            So, join me on this journey as we delve into the fascinating world
            of robotics and programming.

            Arduino boards are used by beginners and professionals alike to
            create simple and complex projects. There are many tutorials and
            accessories available for them.
