          <h3>How many arduino boards you can find?</h3>
          <p>
            There are several sizes and types of arduino boards. Each has
            different advantages.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are <b>bigger</b> ones: Arduino Uno, Arduino Due, Arduino
            Mega, Arduino Leonardo; and <b>smaller:</b> Arduino Nano, Arduino
            Micro arduino boards.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this post, I'll go over some of the more popular ones so you can
            <b>find the one that's right for you</b>.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="contentwrapper">
          <h3>Arduino Uno</h3>
          <p>
            This is the most popular arduino board, and it's the
            <b>best for beginners</b>. (I have one too!)
          </p>
          <p><b>Why?</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Because it has 14 digital input/output and 6 analog inputs pins,
              that's totally enough
            </li>
            <li>Because its output pins operate at 5 volts</li>

            <li>Because you can get many different shields for it</li>
            <li>
              Because you can simply connect it to your computer with a USB
              cable to get started
            </li>
            <li>
              Because if something goes wrong you can replace the
              chip(ATmega328) for a few dollars
            </li>
          </ul>

        <div class="contentwrapper">
          <h3>Arduino Nano</h3>
          <p>
            <q
              >The Arduino Nano is Arduino's classic breadboard friendly
              designed board with the smallest dimensions.</q
            >
            (docs.arduino.cc)
          </p>
          <p>
            It's really <b>small</b>, so if you don't have enough space, this is
            the best arduino for you.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The classical Nano has 14 digital input/output and 8 analog input
              pins
            </li>
            <li>The operating voltage of it is 5V</li>
            <li>
              It has got the same microcontroller(ATmega328) as Arduino Uno
            </li>
            <li>It has got a Mini-B USB port to connect to your computer</li>
            <li>
              Unfortunately it hasn't got a replaceable chip, and you can only
              get a few shields for it (but I think shields aren't that
              important)
            </li>
          </ul>

        </div>

        <div class="contentwrapper">
          <h3>Arduino Mega</h3>
          <p>It's about the same as the arduino uno, only <b>bigger</b>.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              It's got an ATmega2560 microcontroller, but it isn't replaceable
            </li>
            <li>
              It has a <b>lot of digital input/output</b>(54) and a
              <b>lot of analog input pins</b>(16)
            </li>
            <li>The operating voltage of it is 5V</li>
            <li>You can connect it to your computer with an USB cable</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If you make a projects with a lot of sensors and components, it's
            the best arduino for you!

          <h3>Arduino Leonardo</h3>
          <p><q

            ATmega32u4 has <b>built-in USB communication</b>, eliminating the need for
            a secondary processor. This allows the Leonardo to appear to a
            connected computer as a mouse and keyboard, in addition to a virtual
            (CDC) serial / COM port.</q

              It has 20 digital input/output and 12 analog inputs pins
